    <h3>Netflix</h3>
         <p>Of course Netflix is amusing!! I watch Netflix all the time and two of the shows I enjoy watching on Netflix is Grey's Anatomy and Outer Banks.</p>
              <a href="">Click Here to Watch <em><strong>Grey's Anatomy</strong></em></a>
              <a href="">Click Here to Watch <em><strong>Outer Banks</strong></em></a>
         <p>I enjoy these two shows and are currently binge watching one by myself and one with my boyfriend.</p>
    <h3>Pinterest</h3>
              <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Click Here for Pinterest</a>
         <p>Pinterest is a fun website to explore on to find many different things. I often use pinterest to find recipes for baking, smoothies, easy meal planned lunches, and various dinners.</p>
    <h3>Stumble Guys</h3>
              <a href="https://stumble-guys.co/stumble-guys">Click Here to Play Stumble Guys</a>
         <p>It is okay you can laugh. I think <em>Stumble Guys</em> is amusing to play because I enjoy spending time playing it with my boyfriend and my nephews. Stumble Guys is a fun game to download and play!</p>
