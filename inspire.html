        		What makes someone a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to for something they did. Heroes can simply be an individual that made a difference, set an example, and/or showed some strength/grace. The individuals we look up to as our heros and role models can be famous or historical, but can also be a loved one or someone like a movie character.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		Individuals with the following characteristics are what makes someone a hero in my eyes.
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Stand up or speak up - their actions and or voice make a difference and make a scene</li>
        		<li>Courageous - people look up to individuals that perservere through challenges</li>
        		<li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        		<li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
        		<li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		Over the last 100 years no man exemplifies these values for me more than Martin Luther King. He called people to be accountable for the racial prejudices that we all carry. He demonstrated that violence is not the best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed everything to make the world better.
