			<strong>What makes someone a hero?</strong> A hero is someone that we look up to for something they did. Heroes can simply be an individual that made a difference, set an example, and/or showed some strength/grace. The individuals we look up to as our heros and role models can be famous or historical, but can also be a loved one or someone like a movie character.

    		<p>
        		<span><strong>Individuals with the following characteristics are what makes someone a hero in my eyes:</span></strong>
    		</p>
    		<ul>
			<li><em>Stand up or speak up</em> - their actions and or voice make a difference and make a scene</li>
			<li><em>Courageous</em> - people look up to individuals that perservere through challenges</li>
			<li><em>Empowering</em> - impact others through actions to change things such as laws and mind sets</li>
			<li><em>Compassionate</em> - people look up to someone that not only cares about themselves, but instead cares about others as well</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		One individual I believe exemplifies the above characteristics in what makes a hero is Rosa Parks. Rosa Parks is known best for the Montgomery bus boycott. She took a stand against society and stood up for herself to change the limitations society had towards blacks.
